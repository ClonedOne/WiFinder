# WiFinder
WI-FInder is an Android application that allow users to establish an ad-hoc communication between their devices (peers), using WIFI direct technology in order to exchange GPS information, useful to localize all the members of the group.
It requires only informations obtained from GPS and, since it does not use any form of internet or telephone connection, it can be a viable solution even when we are abroad or in places where the signal is low (the jungle!).
